## Features Explained

### The Spotify Bridge
When you paste a Spotify link, Archanid does **not** stream from Spotify (this is technically impossible for bots).

1.  Bot reads track metadata: *Artist - Title*.
2.  Bot searches YouTube Music/SoundCloud for the best audio match.
3.  Bot streams the matched audio.

### Last.fm Integration
Track your listening habits.

1.  Create a [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/) account.
2.  Run `/fm login` and authorize the bot.
3.  **Scrobble:** Every song you listen to is added to your Last.fm profile.
4.  **Flex:** Use `/fm chart` to generate a 3x3 grid of your top albums.

### AI Recommendations
If the queue is empty, enable Autoplay to have Archanid guess what you want to hear next.

*   **Command:** `/autoplay toggle`
*   **Logic:** Uses your listening history + current song genre to queue similar tracks.
