# Setup Guide

Follow these steps to get Archanid up and running in your server perfectly.

## 1. Invite the Bot
Use the official invite link to add Archanid to your server with the required permissions:
[Invite Archanid](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1329184069426348052&permissions=8&scope=bot+applications.commands)

## 2. Initial Configuration
Once the bot joins, it is highly recommended to set up the **Server Architect** first.
- Run `/wizard` to begin the step-by-step infrastructure setup.
- This will help you create channels and roles optimized for the bot's features.

## 3. Setting Up Features
- **Moderation:** Use `/settings` to configure your logging channels and auto-mod sensitivity.
- **Music:** Join a voice channel and use `/play` to start your first session.
- **Economy:** Set up a shop for your server using `/shop create`.

## 4. Need Help?
If you encounter any issues:
1. Use `/help <command>` for specific details.
2. Join our [Support Server](https://discord.gg/fe46sJY8KF).
3. Check the logs in your moderation channel if you have one configured.
